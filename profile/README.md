## Welcome to the FreeMoCap Foundation Github Organzation!

The FreeMoCap Foundation central goal is to promote the accessibility of science and technology, for everyone.

To achieve this goal, we are taking the following scientific, educational, and artistic actions:

- Promote the development of projects that utilize cutting edge science and technology to create, develop, and maintain technological tools that are maximally accessible to potential end users.
- Nurture the creation of free and accessible educational content that pertains to neural control of human movement.
- Advocate for the accessibility of science and technology for artistic implementation; particularly relating to 3D animation, game development, and dance.
